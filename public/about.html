<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Abhishek Vaishav. Now, at present I have passed my 2nd Year of Btech in Computer Engineering and now for further 2 years I have taken Data Structure as a major subject.
  I am doing my btech from RAIT which is under DY Pail University located in Nerul, Navi Mumbai. For my mini projects of this two years, My group has built a calandar app using android studio and python and also made a live cricket score app by using the same tools.
  But for now I am searching for my interest whether it is in app development or web development or is it in some other stuff
. For now I am having fun in web development </p>
